# Real-Time-Chat-Application-Sockets
The purpose of this project is to develop a network chat messenger that will  provide a platform for people to communicate and exchange information in real-time.

## Design of the Project
The project has the following key components:
* Server: The server component of the project is responsible for receiving and broadcasting messages to all the clients connected to it. It creates a socket object and binds it to a particular IP address and port number. It listens for incoming connections from clients and maintains a list of active clients. When a client connects to the server, the server creates a separate thread to handle the client's request. The server also provides support for sending and receiving encrypted messages, audio messages, files, and pictures.
* Client: The client component of the project is responsible for sending and receiving messages to and from the server. The client creates a socket object and connects to the server's IP address and port number. Once connected, the client sends its username to the server, which adds the client to the list of active clients. The client then has the option to send private messages to other clients or broadcast messages to all clients. The client can also send and receive encrypted messages, audio messages, files, and pictures.
* GUI: The graphical user interface (GUI) of the project is developed using Tkinter, a standard Python GUI toolkit. The GUI provides an intuitive interface for the user to interact with the application. It allows the user to enter their username, connect to the server, send messages, and select files and pictures to send. The GUI also displays the messages received from other 
clients, including private messages and broadcast messages.
* Encryption: The project supports encryption of messages using a symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES or DES. When a client sends a message, the message is first encrypted using a pre shared key. The encrypted message is then sent to the server, which decrypts the message using the same key and broadcasts it to all clients. The encryption key is never transmitted over the network, ensuring secure communication between clients.
* Audio Messages, Files, and Pictures: The project supports sending and receiving audio messages, files, and pictures. When a client wants to send an audio message, they select the audio file and send it to the server. The server then broadcasts the audio file to all clients. The same process is followed for sending and receiving files and pictures.
In summary, our web chat room application project is a robust and secure client-server architecture that supports private and broadcast messaging, encryption of messages, and sending and receiving of audio messages, files, and pictures. The project's graphical user interface provides a user-friendly experience, making it easy for users to interact with the application. Overall, this is an impressive project that demonstrates your proficiency in socket programming and Tkinter.
